# TrussChallenge
An physics/engineering game for Android

The goal is to build a two-dimmensional truss that can withstand a given load. Game calculates the axial stresses in the rods and animates the deflections. It has both challenge and sandbox mode.
The forces are calculated exactly, with the use of Navier method, regardless whether the truss is statically determinate or no, so it could be of some use to engineering students.

I wrote first version of this long time ago in C/WindowsAPI, then rewrote this in 2014 for Android to learn Java and some design patterns.

You should be able to clone the repository and open the project in IntelliJ Android Studio.
